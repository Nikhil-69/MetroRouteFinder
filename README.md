Metro Route Optimization Project
Overview
This project focuses on optimizing metro routes using C++ and Dijkstra's algorithm. It incorporates Route files, MetroSystem files, and Stations files to efficiently manage metro station data and find the shortest paths between stations.

Technologies Used
C++ for algorithm implementation and data handling
Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path computation
Features
User-friendly interface for inputting start and end stations
Visualization of the shortest path within the metro network
Integration with Route files, MetroSystem files, and Stations files for comprehensive data management
How to Use
Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler.
Ensure Route files, MetroSystem files, and Stations files are correctly formatted.
Run the executable and follow the prompts to input start and end stations.
The system will display the optimized route, including the number of stations and total distance.
